Objectives:
- A theoretical understanding of the Human-Model Processor, Fitts Law
- Ability to program direct manipulation interactions using a scene graph (paper.js)
- Ability to integrate computational mechanisms into interactions
- Experience in administering a user study

1. DIRECT MANIPULATION - In this problem, you will be using the Paper.js library to create a direct manipulation interaction. The program will allow users to draw and move circles on a canvas using mouse events.
2. CONNECTION TOOL - In this problem, you will be using the Paper.js library to create a connection tool interaction. The goal of this tool is to allow users to draw paths on a canvas and alter the presentation of these connecting lines depending on whether those lines are interacting with other objects in the scene.
3. WIMPY UNDO/REDO - This problem involves computationally representing a userâ€™s coloring activity as a pair of stacks: an undo stack and a redo stack. This encoding is an especially common way to allow users to revert or reapply actions as needed. We will be exposing this interaction through a classic WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers) interaction.
4. MARKING MENU - Marking menus are a type of gesture-based contextual menu interface that allows users to perform actions or select commands by making simple stroke gestures with a pointing device, such as a mouse or stylus. The menu items are typically arranged in a radial pattern around the cursor or touch point, making it easy for users to "mark" their selection by moving in the direction of the desired item. The key advantage of marking menus is their support for both novice and expert users. Novice users can click or tap to open the menu and visually select an option, while expert users can memorize the gestures associated with each menu item, allowing them to quickly execute commands without visually referencing the menu. This "eyes-free" operation speeds up interaction and enhances workflow efficiency.
